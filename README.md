# Assistant

A full-stack web application designed to assist with task management, scheduling, and potentially provide coaching features, possibly tailored for individuals with executive dysfunction. It utilizes AI features and SMS notifications via Twilio.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI, Zustand
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon), Drizzle ORM
*   **Communication:** Twilio (for SMS), SendGrid (for email)
*   **AI:** OpenAI
*   **Testing:** Vitest, Testing Library
*   **Other:** Passport.js (authentication), Zod (validation)

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd assistant
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    *   Copy the example environment file (if one exists, otherwise create one based on required variables like database connection strings, API keys for Twilio, OpenAI, SendGrid, etc.). A `.env` file exists in the root. Ensure it has all necessary keys.
    *   Example: Create a `.env` file in the root directory. You'll need to populate it with credentials for:
        *   Neon Database connection string
        *   Twilio Account SID, Auth Token, and Phone Number
        *   OpenAI API Key
        *   SendGrid API Key
        *   Session Secret
        *   Any other required API keys or configurations.

4.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Ensure your PostgreSQL database (Neon) is running and accessible.
    *   Apply database schema changes:
        ```bash
        npm run db:push
        ```

## Running the Project

*   **Development:** Starts the Vite dev server for the frontend and the Express server for the backend with hot-reloading.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
*   **Build:** Builds the frontend and backend for production.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
*   **Start (Production):** Runs the production build. Ensure you have run `npm run build` first.
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
*   **Type Checking:** Checks the TypeScript code for errors.
    ```bash
    npm run check
    ```

## Project Structure

*   `client/`: Contains the React frontend code.
*   `server/`: Contains the Express backend API code.
*   `shared/`: Likely contains code shared between the client and server (e.g., types, validation schemas).
*   `drizzle/`: Contains database migration files generated by Drizzle Kit.
*   `dist/`: Contains the production build output.
*   `*.js`, `*.ts` (in root): Various test scripts.
