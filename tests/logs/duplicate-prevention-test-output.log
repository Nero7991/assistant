====================================================
Date: March 26, 2025

TEST OBJECTIVE:
Verify that the application properly prevents duplicate follow-up messages 
from being scheduled for the same user, which would cause message spam.

  {
    "id": 130,
    "userId": 4,

----------------------------------------------------
ðŸ§¹ Clearing pending follow-up messages...
âœ… Cleared 1 pending messages

----------------------------------------------------
TEST OUTCOME
----------------------------------------------------
âœ… PASSED: Duplicate prevention is working correctly.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
1. In messaging.ts:
   - Added check for existing pending follow-ups
   - If found, logs and exits without creating duplicate

2. In scheduler.ts:
   - Added similar check for pending follow-ups
   - Prevents creation of duplicate scheduled messages

FIXES APPLIED:
1. Added query to check for existing pending messages
2. Added early return if messages already exist
3. Added proper logging to track attempted duplicates
4. Created test cleanup functionality

END OF TEST REPORT
